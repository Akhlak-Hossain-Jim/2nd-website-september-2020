          <p><em>I'm Jim. I am passionate about entrepreneurship & love to introduce myself as a creative learner. As every student, we've basic problems in the institutional educational system of our country and I know I can't fix it now, so I changed myself and my learning style. Currently, I'm working to connect students to learn in their own creative way together and teach them to learn and listen. If the project I'm working for can bring people together to make a creative learning community, help them accomplish something, or feel them comfort to learn, I'll be the happiest person.</em></p>
          <p><em>I started bearing my finance from 2019 by Tuition and Part-time Job. Maybe I was the one who started Tuition at that age and obviously English version student without having an English version background. I become their favorite by quality time and a creative way to teach.</em></p>
          <p><em>I learned to code and lots of essential career skills in quarantine time by own passion and curiosity. I'd love to learn from everyone for the rest of my life.</em></p>
